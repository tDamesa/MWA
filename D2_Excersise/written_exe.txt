1. The reason we use setImmediate when we want to queue the function behind whatever I/O event
 callbacks that are already in the event queue.   

2. process.nextTick adds a callbacks to nextTick queue which is not a part of event loop. callbacks in nextTick 
queue excuites immediately after the current function completes. It has no limit, all the callbacks get excuited 
before moving to the next event loop phase. setImmediate schedules callbacks to run at chase phase of event loop. 
Callbacks get excuited after I/O events' callbacks.
